/**
 * Provides methods for writing to and reading from job history. 
 * Job History works in an append mode, JobHistory and its inner classes provide methods 
 * to log job events. 
 * 
 * JobHistory is split into multiple files, format of each file is plain text where each line 
 * is of the format [type (key=value)*], where type identifies the type of the record. 
 * Type maps to UID of one of the inner classes of this class. 
 * 
 * Job history is maintained in a master index which contains star/stop times of all jobs with
 * a few other job level properties. Apart from this each job's history is maintained in a seperate history 
 * file. name of job history files follows the format jobtrackerId_jobid
 *  
 * For parsing the job history it supports a listener based interface where each line is parsed
 * and passed to listener. The listener can create an object model of history or look for specific 
 * events and discard rest of the history.  
 * 
 * CHANGE LOG :
 * Version 0 : The history has the following format : 
 *             TAG KEY1="VALUE1" KEY2="VALUE2" and so on. 
               TAG can be Job, Task, MapAttempt or ReduceAttempt. 
               Note that a '"' is the line delimiter.
 * Version 1 : Changes the line delimiter to '.'
               Values are now escaped for unambiguous parsing. 
               Added the Meta tag to store version info.
