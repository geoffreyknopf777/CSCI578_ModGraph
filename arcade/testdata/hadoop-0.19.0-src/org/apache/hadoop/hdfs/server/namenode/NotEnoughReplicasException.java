/** The class is responsible for choosing the desired number of targets
 * for placing block replicas.
 * The replica placement strategy is that if the writer is on a datanode,
 * the 1st replica is placed on the local machine, 
 * otherwise a random datanode. The 2nd replica is placed on a datanode
 * that is on a different rack. The 3rd replica is placed on a datanode
 * which is on the same rack as the first replca.
